## Description

When I want an easy solution for keeping my tasks for the day organized, but I also don't want to subscribe to a new service or have to download software, I can simply open this application to run inside my browser. This app will even work without internet if it is hosted locally. The memory is based on the browsers local storage giving it this un-connected functionallity. 

The application displays the current date at the top, and based off of the current time, the submission areas will be color coded accordingly to give the user an easy visual of where they are at in their tasks.
